the <a> tag defines a hyperlink
The hred attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com"> visit W3schools</a>
The <img src="img_girl.jpg">
1.Absolute URL- Links to a n external image that is hosted on another website Example: src="wwww.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):

<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">
the alt Attribute
The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.
The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
The lang Attribute
You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.ex:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
The title Attribute
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.

The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:

Example
<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
Suggest quotes around attribute values.
